1. Missing Values

The missing values present in the data were addressed by using the imputation methods. Mean imputation and model-based imputation were applied separately on the dataset. Since all the missing values were of categorical types, model imputation could be effective here because the method is simple and robust as it replaces missing values with the most frequent category in the features.

2. Skewness

From the two methods used to handle skewness, log transformation appears to have a much lower skewness when applied on the numerical features. 

Log transformation skewness:
Dexa_Freq_During_Rx    1.405860
Count_Of_Risks        -0.091583

Square root transformation skewness:
Dexa_Freq_During_Rx    1.992495        
Count_Of_Risks        -0.327599

Hence, log transformation method will be used to handle the skewness in the numerical features.


3. Class Imbalance

The imbalance discovered in the target variable (`Persistency_Flag`) will be handled by using the Synthetic oversampling techniques (SMOTE) as it creates synthetic samples that are typical of the minority class, which improves the model's capacity to generalise to previously unknown data. Also, it has the ability to reduce overfitting caused by merely replicating minority class data.

4. Feature Selection

The three methods of feature selection selected different numbers of features based on the logic behind each individual method. However, some of these features were commonly selected by all the three methods. 

Therefore, Race, Ethnicity and few of the 'Risk' categories will be dropped as they were not selected by these methods.
